-- what's in the color box?
-- what does solving the piano do?
-- update game:wrong_item to take custom message, update all wrong_item use accordingly

-- second basement room, this will hold the secret passage that is opened by the piano puzzle, as well as the weights puzzle

items you need:
- screwdriver
- binoculars
✅ matches <- bathroom key
✅ pencil
✅ sheet music
✅ bathroom key <- sheet music && pencil
✅ main key <- screwdriver && matches

the basement light bulb is one of the required items for the weight puzzle.

piano puzzle reward can't be binoculars, as they are required to solve the piano puzzle. that just leaves pencil, screwdriver, or weight puzzle items.
maybe the pencil isn't used for the bathroom door. maybe it's an item for the weight puzzle, and the reward of the weight puzzle is a hat with a hat pin, and the hat pin is used for the bathroom door. the matches are the last thing you need to find.

-- putting down paper sound
-- toilet flush 
-- color box button click sound and open sound

-- scale puzzle
-- don't do locker. just use item on scale.
    -- lock is series of item images?, and somewhere else is a clue that lists weights
    -- maybe there's a picture of scales on the box/door/whatever to indicate that this is where that's used
    -- example: 128, 2486, 93, 75 -> weights of hat, cat, cup, pencil, whatever
    -- maybe not images, like a lock box, but platforms, pressure plates, where items must be placed

-- animate radio dial when buttons are clicked (maybe calculate a percentage value between "    " and "zzzz")
-- animate sound waves / music notes when the radio is on
-- tweak all the messages
