-- what's in the color box?
-- what does solving the piano do?
-- update game:wrong_item to take custom message, update all wrong_item use accordingly

items you need:
- screwdriver <- binoculars
- binoculars
✅ matches <- bathroom key
✅ pencil
✅ sheet music
✅ bathroom key <- sheet music && pencil
✅ main key <- screwdriver && matches
* this is a complete dependency graph, there's no place for the scale puzzle. have to add another step between items.

the basement light bulb is one of the required items for the weight puzzle. but taking it turns the basement dark, and you have to blindly click the ladder to get out. you can blindly put the bulb back as well in order to see.

-- toilet flush 
-- color box button click sound and open sound

-- scale puzzle
-- don't do locker. just use item on scale.
    -- lock is series of item images?, and somewhere else is a clue that lists weights
    -- maybe there's a picture of scales on the box/door/whatever to indicate that this is where that's used
    -- example: 128, 2486, 93, 75 -> weights of hat, cat, cup, pencil, whatever
    -- maybe not images, like a lock box, but platforms, pressure plates, where items must be placed

-- animate radio dial when buttons are clicked (maybe calculate a percentage value between "    " and "zzzz")
-- animate sound waves / music notes when the radio is on
-- tweak all the messages
