-- navigation sfx
-- msg sfx
-- key falling sound
-- putting down paper sound
-- toilet flush 
-- color box button click sound and open sound

-- don't do locker. just use item on scale.
    -- lock is series of item images?, and somewhere else is a clue that lists weights
    -- maybe there's a picture of scales on the box/door/whatever to indicate that this is where that's used
    -- example: 128, 2486, 93, 75 -> weights of hat, cat, cup, pencil, whatever
    -- maybe not images, like a lock box, but platforms, pressure plates, where items must be placed

-- animate radio dial when buttons are clicked (maybe calculate a percentage value between "    " and "zzzz")

-- tweak all the messages
